  p Welcome to #[em LocalLibrary], a very basic Express website developed as a tutorial example on the Mozilla Developer Network. Additionally expanded with more update forms, a search bar and a recommend book function

  h1 The library has the following record counts:

  ul
    li #[strong Books:] !{book_count}
    li #[strong Copies:] !{book_instance_count}
    li #[strong Copies available:] !{book_instance_available_count}
    li #[strong Authors:] !{author_count}
    li #[strong Genres:] !{genre_count}
